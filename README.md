LaunchDarkly Caching Tools for .NET
===================================
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-cache.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-cache)

This library provides a caching abstraction used by other LaunchDarkly .NET assemblies. .NET provides several caching tools, but their functionality differs between .NET Framework and .NET Standard and does not include some desired behaviors.

.NET platform compatibility
---------------------------

This version of the library is compatible with .NET Framework version 4.5 and above, .NET Standard 1.6, and .NET Standard 2.0.

Signing
-------

The published version of this assembly is digitally signed with Authenticode, and also strong-named. Building the code locally in the default Debug configuration does not sign the assembly and does not require a key file.

Development notes
-----------------

This project imports the `dotnet-base` repository as a subtree. See the `README.md` file in that directory for more information.

Releases are done using the release script in `dotnet-base`. Since the published package includes a .NET Framework 4.5 build, the release must be done from Windows.

About LaunchDarkly
------------------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
